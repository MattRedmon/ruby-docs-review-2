# Enumerable Module

# the Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with traversal, searching and sort methods
# the class must provide a method each, which yields successive members of the collection
# if Enumerable#max, #min, or #sort is used, the objects in the collection must also
# implement a meaningful <=> operator, as these methods rely on an ordering between members of collection
